Australis-Hello-World-with-Badge
=====================

This is a forked addon from jvillalobos which shows how to put a badge on a toolbarbutton when it is in the the nav bar (meaning when area is equal to `CustomizableUI.AREA_NAVBAR`)

Tip: if you want to change the text of the badge, then in toolbar.css set `content: 'attr(x-badge-txt)'` (currently it is `content: '10`) and then whenever you change the attribute value of `x-badge-txt` it will change the badge text.
